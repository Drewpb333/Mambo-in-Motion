# Mambo in Motion

Mambo in Motion is a web-based application utilizing React, database management, Web Bluetooth API, and user authentication.  The application of drones in todayâ€™s society offers a myriad of opportunities.  Mambo in Motion focuses on using the Parrot Mambo drone in an entertaining and educational manner.  Our application utilizes both the autonomous functions as well as the real-time, user-controlled functions of its SDK.

## Setup

Mambo in Motion currently utilizes the Web Bluetooth API, an experimental technology, and thus is not supported in most browsers.  The latest version of Google Chrome is recommended for using Mambo in Motion.

* To use Mambo in Motion, go to `chrome://inspect/#devices` and enable port forwarding for port 8080.

* Turn on the Parrot Mambo drone and wait until the lights are flashing green.

* Press the 'Connect' button from the browser and select your drone name to pair with.

* You are now ready to fly!
